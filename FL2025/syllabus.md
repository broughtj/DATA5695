## Course Description

The orientation of this course is unapologetically philosophical. The
main mode of course delivery will be the [Socratic
Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_method). I will typically
play the role of the questioner, but not exclusively. You are highly
encouraged to play this role when appropriate. The Socratic method
revolves around asking and answering questions. Ward Farnsworth gets at
the essence of this mode better than anyone I know with these
quotations:

## Course Mechanics

> *“The Socratic method is a style of thought. It is a help toward
> intelligence and an antidote to stupidity. This has to be said right
> away because many people consider the Socratic method, if they
> consider it at all, to be a technique for teaching. It is that; but
> the reason the Socratic method is useful in the classroom is that it’s
> a style of thought better than the one we tend to apply naturally to
> important things. Socrates didn’t question people in order to teach us
> how to question people. He did it to teach us how to think. That is
> what makes his method a matter of general interest, not a device for
> specialists or special occasions.”*

> *“As an inhabitant of a university, I especially mean this book to
> broadly suggest the ethic by which such institutions function best.
> Their health requires Socratic commitments: to reason, to refutation,
> and to not flinching when hard questions are put on the table.* ***A
> university should be a Socratic gymnasium.”***

> *Treating the characters as sides of Plato’s own mind is a helpful way
> to think about the value of the dialogues now. It lets them serve as a
> model for the same in anyone else:* ***a way to think about things on
> your own.*** *Granted, any philosopher’s writings – in a treatise or
> essay, say – might be viewed as a thought process that the reader is
> invited to internalize. But a dialogue is distinctly well suited for
> the purpose.* ***Questions and answers are the sound of thought
> happening.*** *An essay or lecture is usually the sound of thought*
> ***having*** *happened, then polished up so the result is clear and
> the process of getting there is no longer visible. Ordinarily that’s
> good. If you know what you think and want someone else to know it,
> explaining it straight out makes sense. But if you want to provide a
> model for getting there – for what to do before you know what you
> think – a dialogue is ideal because it illustrates the process of
> figuring that out. In Plato’s case the dialogues are studies in how to
> think about hard things. They show him doing it. And writing out your
> own little dialogues is, in fact, a good way to sort out your thinking
> and to develop ability with the Socratic method.”*

At the heart of FinTech is entrepreneurial financial innovation (and
arbitrage!). This means *per force* doing something that has never been
done before and that means *per force* thinking in a way that has never
been thought in before. No FinTech entrepreneur can be successful
without mastering the Socratic method! Full stop. There are many who
have done so without knowing it explicitly. So much the better if you
figure it out explicitly! This course will present the Socratic method
in several levels and in many of its aspects: including quantitative and
technological ones!

### Course Communications, Materials, Etc

- This course will use Canvas minimally
- We will communicate mostly via the Microsoft Teams channel
- I will create a Box drive and share all readings, data, etc with you
- There will be a GitHub repo for the course through which I will share
  course artifacts and content
- Students will be expected to submit all of their work via GitHub

### Assessment

- Course participation (50%)
  - Course discussions and lessons are meant to help you complete your
    exams.
  - I expect students to drive this process with questions, and problems
    based upon their preparation and study.
- Midterms and final (50%)
  - Each exam will have essays focusing on philosophical, historical and
    theoretical concepts.
  - Additionally, the exams will have core quantitative and programming
    problems to help students develop skills in computational financial
    modeling.
