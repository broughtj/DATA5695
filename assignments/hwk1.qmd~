# Introduction

This homework assignment is all about the Binomial options pricing model. It is based on Chapters 9, 10, 11 of the McDonald text.


## Chapter 9: Parity and Other Option Relationships

__9.1__ A stock currently sells for $\$32.00$. A $6$-month call option with a strike of $\$35$ has a premium of $\$2.27$. Assuming a $4\%$ continuously compounded risk-free rate and a $6\%$ continuous dividend yield, what is the price of the associated put option?



__9.2.__ A stock currently sells for $\$32.00$. A $6$-month call option with a strike of $\$30.00$ has a premium of $\$4.29$, and a $6$-month put with the same strike has a premium of $\$2.64$. Assume a $4\%$ continuously compounded risk-free rate. What is the present value of the dividends payable over the next $6$ months?



__9.3__ Suppose the S&R index is $800$, the continuously compounded risk-free rate is $5\%$, and the dividend yield is $0\%$. A $1$-year $815$-strike European call costs $\$75$ and a $1$-year $815$-strike European put costs $\$45$. Consider the strategy of buying the stock, selling the $815$-strike call, and buying the $815$-strike put.

- __a.__ What is the rate of return on this position held until the expiration of the options?

- __b.__ What is the arbitrage implied by your answer to (a)?

- __c.__ What difference between the call and put prices would eliminate arbitrage?

- __d.__ What difference between the call and put prices eliminates arbitrage for strike prices of $\$780$, $\$820$, and $\$840$?



__9.8__ Suppose call and put prices are given by


| __Strike__   | __$50$__ | __$55$__ |
|:-------------|---------:|---------:|
| Call Premium | 9        | 10       |
| Put Premium  | 7        | 6        |

What no-arbitrage property is violated? What spread position would you use to effect arbitrage? Demonstrate that the spread position is an arbitrage?


__9.9__ Suppose call and put prices are given by

| __Strike__   | __$50$__ | __$55$__ |
|:-------------|---------:|---------:|
| Call premium | 16       | 10       |
| Put  premium | 7        | 14       |

What no-arbitrage property is violated? What spread position would you use to effect arbitrage? Demonstrate that the spread position is an arbitrage?

__9.10__ Suppose call and put prices are given by

| __Strike__   | __$50$__ | __$55$__ | __$60$__ |
|:-------------|---------:|---------:|---------:|
| Call premium | 18       | 14       | 9.50     |
| Put premium  | 7        | 10.75    | 14.45    |


Find the convexity violations. What spread would you use to effect arbitrage? Demonstrate that the spread position is an arbitrage?


__9.12__ In each case identify the arbitrage and demonstrate how you would make money by creating a table showing your payoff.

- __a.__ Consider two European options on the same stock with the same time to expiration. The $90$-strike call costs $\$10$ and the $\95$-strike call costs $\$4$.

- __b.__ Now suppose these options have $2$ years to expiration and the continously compounded interest rate is $10\%$. The $90$-strike call costs $\$10$ and the $95$-strike call costs $\$5.25$. Show again that there is an arbitrage opportunity. (__Hint:__ It is important in this case that the options are European.)

- __c.__ Suppose that a $90$-strike European call sells for $\$15$, a $100$-strike call sells for $\$10$, and a $105$-strike calls sells for $\$6$. Show how you could use an asymmetric butterfly to profit from this arbitrage opportunity.


## Chapter 10: Binomial Option Pricing -- Basic Concepts

__10.1__ Let $S = \$100$, $K = \$105$, $r = 8\%$, $T = 0.5$, and $\delta = 0$. Let $u = 1.3$, $d = 0.8$, and $n = 1$.

__10.3__ Let $S = \$100$, $K = \$95$, $r = 8\%$, $T = 0.5$, and $\delta = 0$. Let $u = 1.3$, and $d = 0.8$, and $n = 1$.

- __a.__ Verify that the price of a European put is $\$7.471$.

- __b.__ Suppose you observe a put price of $\$8$. What is the arbitrage?

- __c.__ Suppose you observe a put price of $\$6$. What is the arbitrage?



__10.4__ Obtain at least $5$ years' worth of daily stock price data for a stock of your choice.

- __1.__ Compute annual volatility using all the data.

- __2.__ Compute annual volatility for each calendar year in your data. How does volatility vary over time?

- __3.__ Compute annual volatility for the first and second half of each year in your data. How much variation is there in your estimate?



__10.5__ Obtain at least $10$ years of daily data for five stocks. Estimate annual volatility for each year for each asset in your data. What do you observe about the pattern of historical volatility over time? Does historical volatility move in tandem for different assets?



__10.6__ Let $S = \$100$, $K = \$95$, $\sigma = 30\%$, $r = 8\%$, $T = 1$, and $\delta = 0$. Let $u = 1.3$, $d = 0.8$, and $n = 2$. Construct the binomial tree for a call option. At each node provide the premium, $\Delta$, and $B$.



__10.8__ Let $S = \$100$, $K = \$95$, $\sigma = 30\%$, $r = 8\%$, $T = 1$, and $\delta = 0$. Let $u = 1.3$, $d = 0.8$, and $n = 2$. Construct the binomial tree for a European put option. At each node provide the premium, $\Delta$, and $B$.



__10.10__ Let $S = \$100$, $K = \$95$, $\sigma = 30\%$, $r = 8\%$, $T = 1$, and $\delta = 0$. Let $u = 1.3$, $d = 0.8$, and $n = 2$. Construct the binomial tree for an American put option. At each node provide the premium, $\Delta$, and $B$.



__10.11__ Suppose $S_{0} = \$100$, $K = \$50$, $r = 7.696\%$ (continuously compounded), $\delta = 0$, and $T = 1$.

- __a.__ Suppose that for $h = 1$, we have $u = 1.2$ and $d = 1.05$. What is the binomial option price for a call option that lives one period? Is there any problem with having $d > 1$?

- __b.__ Suppose now that $u = 1.4$ and $d = 0.6$. Before computing the option price, what is your guess about how it will change from your previous answer? Does it change? How do you account for the result? Interpret your answer using put-call parity.

- __c.__ Now let $u = 1.4$ and $d = 0.4$. How do you think the call option price will change from (a)? How does it change? How do you account for this? Use put-call parity to explain your answer.



__10.12__ Let $S = \$100$, $K = \$95$, $r = 8\%$ (continously compounded), $\sigma = 30\%$, $\delta = 0$, $T = 1$ year, and $n = 3$.

- __a.__ Verify that the binomial option price for an American call option is $\$18.283$. Verify that there is never early exercise; hence, a European call would have the same price.

- __b.__ Show that the binomial option price for European put option is $\$5.979$. Verify that put-call parity is satisfied.

- __c.__ Verify that the price of an American put is $\$6.678$.



__10.21__ For a stock index, $S = \$100$, $\sigma = 30\%$, $r = 5\%$, $\delta = 3\%$, and $T = 3$. Let $n = 3$.

- __a.__ What is the price of a European call option with a strike of $\$95$?

- __b.__ What is the price of a European put option with a strike of $\$95$.

- __c.__ Now let $S = \$95$, $K = \$100$, $\sigma = 30\%$, $r = 3\%$, and $\delta = 5\%$. (You have exchanged values for the stock price and strike price and for the interest rate and dividend yield.) Value both options again. What do you notice?



__10.22__ Repeat the previous problem calculating prices for American options instead of European. What happens?



## Chapter 11: Binomial Option Pricing -- Selected Topics

__11.7__ Let $S = \$100$, $K = \$100$, $\sigma = 30\%$, $r = 0.08$, $t = 1$, and $\delta = 0$. Let $n = 10$. Suppose the stock has an expected return of $15\%$.

- __a.__ What is the expected return on a European call option? A European put option?

- __b.__ What happens to the expected return if you increase the volatility to $50\%$?
